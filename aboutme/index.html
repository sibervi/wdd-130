    <p>I'm from Sao Paulo Brazil, majoring in Software Engineering I'm in my first year here in Rexburg/United States. My favorite color is yellow!</p>
    <p>I'm single and I don't have children.</p> 
    <p>I don't have a current career, but I'm interested in trying Quality Assurance or Project Management.</p>
    <p>What I love about BYU-I is the opportunity to learn professional concepts with spiritual view and experiences.</p>
    <p>My mom got baptize when I was 10 months, so I grow up in the Church, I served a mission in Juiz de Fora Brazil. A favorite quote from a leader is all changing, but I love this quote by Elder Dale G. Renlund: "Do not let unfairness harden you or corrode your faith in God. Instead, ask God for help. Increase your appreciation for and reliance on the Savior. Rather than becoming bitter, let Him help you become better." </p>
